In the early 1990s, rap took over the radio: Songs by Snoop Dogg and Jay Z played everywhere. Was this a musical revolution or merely the result of a gradual change in tastes over time? Researchers say they’re now able to answer such questions, thanks to the largest data-driven study of pop music ever undertaken. Applying evolutionary theory to this data set, they say, could settle several debates that have raged over pop music for decades.

二十世纪九十年代早期，rap说唱成为了无线传播的主体，Snoop Dogg和Jay z 演唱的歌曲随处可见。这是一次音乐的革命或仅仅是人们的品味随时间变化的一种结果？基于曾进行的规模最大的数据驱动的流行音乐的研究，研究者们说他们现在可以回答这个问题。他们声称，通过在这个数据集上应用进化理论，可以解决在数十年间有关流行音乐的激烈辩论。

Among art forms, music seems particularly well suited to data-driven analysis. After all, the features that distinguish one piece of music from another—rhythm, harmony, melody—are intrinsically mathematical. Researchers have long wanted to study the evolution of music with the same rigorous tools that biologists use to study the evolution of species. But tangled copyright protections make it difficult to access musical data sets on a large scale, because even data mining of musical recordings may not be allowed without permission. And determining a representative sample of musical culture for a particular place and time is challenging. For example, even though we have millions of musical scores from the Baroque era, we have no idea how often any of them were actually performed.

在各种艺术形式中，音乐似乎是特别适合进行数据驱动的分析的一种。而且，用来区分音乐的特征（如节奏，旋律，和声等）在本质上是可以很好的用数学来描述的。研究者们之前一直很希望通过生物学家研究物种演化的严格工具（方法）来研究音乐的演化。但是版权保护使得人们很难得到大范围的音乐数据集，因为没有许可即使是在歌曲的录音上进行数据挖掘也是不被允许的。而且某个特定时间特定地点为音乐文化确定一个有代表性的样本也是一项挑战。举例来说，即使我们有了巴洛克时期数百万的音乐，我们依旧不知道这些音乐多久会被演奏一次。

To solve the sampling problem, a team led by Matthias Mauch, a computer scientist at the Queen Mary University of London, turned to the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, the American music industry's weekly list of popular singles. The researchers scraped data from the Billboard website, collecting the titles and artists for some 17,000 songs that made the list between 1960 and 2010.

为了解决抽样问题，由Queen Mary University of London 计算机科学家Matthias Mauch领导的团队，求助于美国的billboard Hot 100，一个美国的音乐届每周最火音乐清单。研究者从Billboard网站上抓取数据，收集从1960年到2010年的大约17000首歌的歌名和演唱者。

Getting the actual song recordings was the trickier problem. Luckily, Mauch used to work at the British online music recommendation service Last.fm, and he knew the company had a vast database of 30-second music samples that it used to preview its wares. Those samples turned out to be large enough to power a massive comparative analysis.

获取真实的歌曲是更难的问题。幸运的是，Mauch曾经在英国在线音乐推荐机构Last.fm工作，他知道这家公司有一个大型的数据库，里面存放有大量用于预览的30秒歌曲样本。这些样本对于提供庞大的分析比较是足够大的。

Rather than relying on human judgment to compare songs, the team used a statistical technique that extracts features of the recordings like timbre and harmony before grouping them into clusters. To make sure the clusters were meaningful, the researchers compared them with groups of songs created by Last.fm’s millions of users. For example, users put songs by Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, and Jay Z together in the “rap and hip hop” category. But using just the timbre and harmony features, the computer clustered them into nearly identical groups. Encouraged by the similarity, the team then analyzed these massive data with an evolutionary analysis, treating the statistical traits shared among songs like biological traits.

与其依赖人工判断来比较歌，团队使用了一种统计技术，在分组成集群之前提取出歌曲的特征如音色和和旋。为了确保每个集群有意义，研究者将这些组合Last.fm上百万用户分的组进行比较。比如，用户将Snoop Dogg, Ludacris和Jay Z的歌都放在“说唱和嘻哈”这个目录下。但是仅仅只用音色和和旋作为特征，电脑将他们聚类成差不多相似的组群。受相似性的启发，团队接下来用一种进化方法来分析这些大数据，像对待生物特征一样对待这些歌之间的统计特征。

Far from becoming formulaic and homogeneous, as some critics have argued, pop music is as diverse now as it has ever been, the researchers found. And it didn’t evolve gradually. Instead, the analysis revealed several dramatic revolutions. The first was in 1964 during the rise of rock and soul music, when bands such as the Beatles drew huge crowds. The next started in 1983 with disco, new wave, and hard rock. And the most recent, and by far the most transformative, started in 1991 with the explosion in rap and hip hop. As Mauch and his team conclude today in Royal Society Open Science, rap is "the single most important event that has shaped the musical structure of the American charts over the past 50 years." Its powerful influence on the structure of pop music continues today; the occasional rap interlude now finds its way into many a rock song, for example.

正如一些评论家讨论的，一些研究者发现，流行音乐远未成为公式化的，同质的，如今的流行音乐比以往任何时候都多样。它不是逐渐地进化。相反，分析揭露了一些戏剧性的革命。第一次是1964年摇滚和黑人乐崛起，当时的乐队比如披头士合唱（摇滚乐队）吸引了大批的观众。接着是1983年迪斯科、新浪潮和重摇滚的出现。近年来，最近为止最有革命性的是1991年出现的说唱和嘻哈文化的爆发。正如Mauch和他的团队总结的那样，现在在皇家学会开放科学中，说唱是“过去50年中形成美国排行榜音乐结构的最重要的一次事件”。它在流行音乐结构上的强大影响延续至今，比如，许多摇滚歌曲中都穿插着说唱的形式。

"This is rigorous," says Jean-Baptiste Michel, a data scientist at Harvard University and Palantir Technologies, which is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, who was lead author of a 2010 Science paper that kicked off the study of culture through massive data sets. "More researchers need to take this approach." One of the findings that stands out, he says, is that pop music shows a pattern from biological evolution known as punctuated equilibrium, in which periods of gradual change are separated by explosions of complexity. The most famous example in geological history is the Cambrian explosion, a sudden, massive increase in biodiversity in the fossil record 542 million years ago. "There are differences, of course," he says, "since biological evolution has the direct parent-offspring relationship, and we don't know the mechanisms even in biology. So we have to be careful."

Jean-Baptiste Michel，一个哈佛大学和palantir科技（总部设立在帕洛阿尔托）的数据科学家，他是2010年科技论文kicked off the study of culture through massive data sets的首席作者,他指出：“这是严格的，更多的研究者需要采用这样的方法”。其中的一个发现表明流行音乐显示出了一种著名的间断均衡的生物进化的模式，渐变的阶段被爆炸的复杂性分割。在地质历史上最著名的例子便是寒武纪大爆发，542万年前化石记录中的一次生物多样性突然地、密集地增长。Jean-Baptiste Michel说，“当然他们之间存在区别，因为生物进化有直接的亲子间的关系，而我们甚至并不知道他们在生物学中的原理。因此，我们必须要小心谨慎”。
